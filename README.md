# StudentGradeManager
GradeTracker is a Python-based app to manage student grades. It allows users to enter grades, calculate averages, save records to a file, and view saved data. With a simple menu, it's an easy-to-use tool for tracking academic performance and maintaining grade history.

1. Each new grade entry should be saved, and previous data will be deleted unless it is saved before every new entry.
2. Data is stored in the file.txt.
3. Attempting to save or calculate the average without entering data through option 1 may lead to an error.
4. Trying to save without calculating the average of the input may result in an error.
